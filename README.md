## About Me

I am currently undergoing a career transition into **programming** and **cybersecurity**.

# Portfolio

Here you will find a collection of my work and projects. Below are the **knowledge** and **skills** I have acquired through various endeavors, including **bootcamp training**, **coursework at 42**, and **personal projects**:


## [Bootcamp in Cybersecurity](https://github.com/Juan-aga/42-BootCamp_CyberSecurity)

<!-- [![juan-aga's 42 stats](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cli8xz75i005408mh2tn5hewj/stats?cursusId=58&coalitionId=undefined)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42) -->


During the Bootcamp, I had the opportunity to **work on a variety of projects** in a **dynamic and up-to-date cybersecurity environment**. Some of the notable projects I worked on include:

- Creation of **hidden services** (onion) through **Tor**.
- **Web scraping** of images from websites.
- Simulation of **ransomware attacks**.
- Implementation of Time-based One-Time Password (**TOTP**) keys.
- Proof of **concept for a blockchain** with Proof of Work (**PoW**).
- **File recovery** in Windows 10.
- Simulation of **attacks** on **RSA** keys and **ARP spoofing**.


## [42 Cursus](https://github.com/Juan-aga/42-Cursus)

During my participation in the 42 cursus, I acquired the following knowledge and skills:

- **C and C++ programming**.
- **Algorithm development** and **data structures**.
- **Collaborative work** in **development environments**.
- **Complex problem solving**.
- Use of **version control** tools like **Git**.
- **Project development** using **agile** methodologies.

## [Personal Projects](https://github.com/Juan-aga/other_resources/)

### [headernorm](https://github.com/Juan-aga/headernorm-42)
This **bash script** checks the headers of C and header files, ensuring they adhere to coding standards and displaying warnings for multiple contributors. It also checks the norm and can be easily integrated into your workflow.

### [Memory_Leaks](https://github.com/Juan-aga/memory-leaks)
A **library** for detecting **memory leaks in C** programs. By including `memory_leaks.h` in your headers, it **traces memory allocations** and **provides** a detailed **report** upon program exit. Works on both Mac and Linux platforms.

### [Invoke-Obfuscation-Desobfuscation](https://github.com/Juan-aga/Invoke-Obfuscation-Desobfuscation)
This repository provides information and scripts for **deobfuscating** commands or scripts **obfuscated with Invoke-Obfuscation**. It includes the original tool, as well as additional resources for determining if a command is obfuscated.

### [Headernorm in python](https://github.com/Juan-aga/Checker_headers_norminette_42/)

Headernorm is a tool for checking the modification of header files (.c and .h) by users. It verifies that the header files have been modified by the same users. It also performs norminette checks and provides error output only.

### [Checker functions allowed ](https://github.com/Juan-aga/Checker_functions_allowed_42/)

In progres...

This project aims to inspect the source files of 42 School projects and verify whether they utilize prohibited functions.
